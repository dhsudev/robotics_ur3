Exercices to learn some features of ur3 robots

## Some basic programs
In this folder you can check some of my first programs to get to know with the robot and it's functions
## Comunicating with the robot
Communicating with the robot from other devices it's such a great functionality to implement and learn. I've tried some protocols to get to know with them and be able to decide in a furute project which one i want to use.
### Socket
I've implemented a socket server in java and a program in the robot to connect to the server. In this exercice, the robot sends the current position to the server and waits for a response of a new pose.
### XML-RPC
This is very similar to the last exercice but using the XML-RPC protocol
### Investigation project
To be continued...
## URCaps
### Starting with URCaps
### My own URCap for a custom grip
